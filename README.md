===============

Note: you will need to enable UI scripting in OSX via Accessibility options in your system preferences pane. You can do so by enabling access for assistive devices in the accessibility pane.

A repository for some very useful workflows:



* The Toggleflux workflow enables you to simply disable or enable flux for a period of 1 hour. 

* The Flux Lighting Option workflow lets you select lighting options such as Tungsten, Candle, Fluorescent, etc.
 
* Added Retina Display Resolution Swap. This enables the user to switch between 1680x1050 and 1920x1200 resolution.
